# Exploration and explanation of a Flight Dataset
This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

### Project Status
Completed

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to acquire skills in data visualization

## Project Description
Flight delays are inevitable. The data provided by the United States department of transportation tell us that 80% of flights are ontime and 20% are delayed. However there is a 15 minutes rule for being ontime: In the U.S. ontime is counted as any departure/arrival up to 15 minutes of the scheduled time. I choose 3 years to compare general data like arrival delay, departure delay , airlines etc. One year in the 90ies and the years 2004 and 2008 to see if there where any changes in this 10 year period for this variables. To make a brief comparison between the reasons for the delays (airline, wheather, late incoming aircraft etc.) I just used 2004 and 2008 data as these variables were not recorded in 1998. I explored whether there were changes in delays between airlines, years, airports etc and reasons for delays. Furthermore I explored the impact of the 15 minutes rule on delay times and statistics for airports and airlines.
